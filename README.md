**Tutorial for CultureBERT, a transformer-based language model to measure corporate culture**

CultureBERT was trained on 1,400 employee reviews to measure corporate culture. More specifically, it predicts corporate culture based on the four culture dimensions of the Competing Values Framework.

You can use this notebook to directly use CultureBERT to predict corporate culture on your own text.
